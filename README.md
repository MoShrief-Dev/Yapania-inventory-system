# Yapania - Inventory
This is a project I'm building to help my family's business, move into the digital space. We distribute enterprise-grade printers, and I wanted to create a tool that actually helps our customers and simplifies my dad's workflow.

## The Problem
In Egypt, buying used enterprise hardware like Samsung or HP usually involves a lot of trust. Customers often travel hours just to check the condition of a machine. I wanted to use my CS skills to fix that.

## What this project does
* **3D Virtual Inspection:** I'm using LiDAR technology to create 3D Digital Twins of our printers. This lets a customer in Cairo or Alexandria rotate the machine on our site to check the rollers and ports before they buy.
* **Lead Automation:** Instead of a basic form, I integrated a WhatsApp-direct pipeline so the business gets a message with the exact model the customer is viewing.
* **Inventory Management:** Moving our stock from "notebooks" to a real web-based system.

## My Growth as a Developer
I'm currently taking **CS50x** and training for **USACO**, and this project is where I put those concepts into practice. 
* I'm learning how to optimize large 3D assets so the site doesn't lag on slower networks.
* It's my first time managing a real-world "Product Lifecycle.
